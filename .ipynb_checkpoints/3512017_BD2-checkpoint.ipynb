    "| Pass | To pass, you must submit sufficient working code to show that you have mastered the basics of the task, even if not everything works completely. You must include some justifications for your choice of methods, but without mentioning alternatives. |\n",
    "| Merit | For a merit, your code must be mostly correct, with only small problems or parts missing, and your comments must be useful rather than simply re-stating the code in English. Most choices for methods and structures should be explained and alternatives mentioned. |\n",
    "| Distinction | For a distinction, your code must be working, correct, and well commented and shows an appreciation of style, efficiency and reliability. All choices for methods and structures are concisely justified and alternatives are given well thought considerations. For a distinction, your work should be good enough to present to executives at the company.|\n",

    "\n",
    "Plagiarism is presenting somebody else’s work as your own **and includes the use of artificial intelligence tools beyond AIAS Level 2 or the use of Large Language Models.**. Plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct and is taken very seriously by the University. Students found to have plagiarised work can have marks deducted and, in serious cases, even be expelled from the University. Do not submit any work that is not entirely your own.

There is no single right answer, the aim is to simply show you are competent in using python for data analysis. Exactly how you do that is up to you.\n",

    " 2. **Data understanding and preparation** - Explore the data and show you understand its structure and relations, with the aid of appropriate visualisation techniques. Assess the data quality, which insights you would be able to answer from it, and what preparation the data would require. Add new data from another source if required to bring new insights to the data you already have.\n",
    " 3. **Data modeling (optional)** - Would modeling be required for the insights you have considered? Use appropriate techniques, if so.\n",
    " 4. **Evaluation and deployment** - How do the insights you obtained help the company, and how can should they be adopted in their business? If modeling techniques have been adopted, are their use scientifically sound and how should they be mantained?"
